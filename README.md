# Medieval Action RPG (2D)

This project is an early-stage 2D medieval action RPG built with Unity 6.2. The goal is to create a responsive movement system, basic combat mechanics, and an expandable world structure suitable for further development.

## Project Overview
The game is structured as a top-down action RPG prototype. Current features focus on movement, animation, and foundational scene building. This repository will evolve as new systems such as combat, enemy AI, and environment interactions are implemented.

## Current Features
- Player movement with directional input and basic animations (idle and walking)
- Input system configuration using Unityâ€™s Input System
- Scene setup for initial gameplay environment
- Early sprite assets for terrain, structures, and characters
- Tilemap elevation scripts for basic environmental interaction

## Project Structure
- `Assets/Scenes`: Contains the main scene (`rpg.unity`)
- `Assets/Scripts`: Player controller and movement scripts, tilemap interaction scripts
- `Assets/Sprites`: Player sprite, environment tiles, structure sprites, animation clips (idle, walking)
- `Assets/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions`: Input mapping configuration

## Technologies Used
- Unity 6.2 (2D)
- C#
- Unity Input System
- Tilemap

## Status
This is a work in progress. Core systems are being developed and will be expanded with combat mechanics, enemy AI, inventory, and quest systems.

## Future Plans
- Combat and health system
- Enemy AI
- Inventory and interaction mechanics
- Environmental effects and level design improvements

## License
This project is currently under development and not yet licensed for public distribution. Licensing will be determined at a later stage.
